echo "ðŸ“‹ INTEGRATION APPROACH:"
echo "Strands uses @tool decorator - our tool is already compatible!"
echo "We need to create an example/demo rather than modify core Strands"
echo ""

echo "ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDED APPROACH:"
echo "1. Create example in Strands examples directory"
echo "2. Show RDS Discovery as a Strands tool usage example"
echo "3. Submit as community contribution"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“‹ COMMANDS TO RUN:"
echo ""
echo "# 1. Fork and clone Strands"
echo "# Go to: https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python"
echo "# Click Fork, then:"
echo "git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sdk-python.git"
echo "cd sdk-python"
echo "git checkout -b add-rds-discovery-example"
echo ""

echo "# 2. Create example directory"
echo "mkdir -p examples/rds_discovery"
echo ""

echo "# 3. Copy our tool files"
echo "cp /home/bacrifai/strands-rds-discovery/src/rds_discovery.py examples/rds_discovery/"
echo "cp /home/bacrifai/strands-rds-discovery/src/sql_queries.py examples/rds_discovery/"
echo ""

echo "# 4. Create example usage script"
echo "# We'll create example_usage.py showing how to use RDS Discovery with Strands"
echo ""

echo "# 5. Add documentation"
echo "cp /home/bacrifai/strands-rds-discovery/README.md examples/rds_discovery/"
echo ""

echo "# 6. Add requirements"
echo "echo 'pyodbc>=4.0.0' > examples/rds_discovery/requirements.txt"
echo ""

echo "# 7. Commit and create PR"
echo "git add examples/rds_discovery/"
echo "git commit -m 'Add RDS Discovery tool example for SQL Server migration assessment'"
echo "git push origin add-rds-discovery-example"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“‹ WHAT YOU NEED:"
echo "1. Your GitHub username"
echo "2. Fork the Strands repository"
echo ""

echo "ðŸŽ¯ This approach:"
echo "âœ… Doesn't modify core Strands code"
echo "âœ… Shows RDS Discovery as example usage"
echo "âœ… More likely to be accepted"
echo "âœ… Demonstrates Strands tool capabilities"
