This guide provides best practices for deploying Strands agents in production environments, focusing on security, stability, and performance optimization.

## Production Configuration

When transitioning from development to production, it’s essential to configure your agents for optimal performance, security, and reliability. The following sections outline key considerations and recommended settings.

### Agent Initialization

For production deployments, initialize your agents with explicit configurations tailored to your production requirements rather than relying on defaults.

#### Model configuration

For example, passing in models with specific configuration properties:

```python
agent_model = BedrockModel(
    model_id="us.amazon.nova-premier-v1:0",
    temperature=0.3,
    max_tokens=2000,
    top_p=0.8,
)

agent = Agent(model=agent_model)
```

See:

-   [Bedrock Model Usage](/docs/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/amazon-bedrock/index.md#basic-usage)
-   [Ollama Model Usage](/docs/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/ollama/index.md#basic-usage)

### Tool Management

In production environments, it’s critical to control which tools are available to your agent. You should:

-   **Explicitly Specify Tools**: Always provide an explicit list of tools rather than loading all available tools
-   **Keep Automatic Tool Loading Disabled**: For stability in production, keep automatic loading and reloading of tools disabled (the default behavior)
-   **Audit Tool Usage**: Regularly review which tools are being used and remove any that aren’t necessary for your use case

```python
agent = Agent(
    ...,
    # Explicitly specify tools
    tools=[weather_research, weather_analysis, summarizer],
    # Automatic tool loading is disabled by default (recommended for production)
    # load_tools_from_directory=False,  # This is the default
)
```

See [Adding Tools to Agents](/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/index.md#adding-tools-to-agents) and [Auto reloading tools](/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/index.md#auto-loading-and-reloading-tools) for more information.

### Security Considerations

For production environments:

1.  **Tool Permissions**: Review and restrict the permissions of each tool to follow the principle of least privilege
2.  **Input Validation**: Always validate user inputs before passing to Strands Agents
3.  **Output Sanitization**: Sanitize outputs for sensitive information. Consider leveraging [guardrails](/docs/user-guide/safety-security/guardrails/index.md) as an automated mechanism.

## Performance Optimization

### Execution Limits

Every production agent should have explicit execution boundaries. Choose limits that match the request’s service-level objective and cost budget, then monitor how often each limit is reached. A useful baseline covers four independent dimensions:

1.  **Agent loop iterations**: Set per-invocation turn limits by passing `limits`, which is named the same in both SDKs. A turn limit bounds repeated model and tool cycles and prevents an agent from running indefinitely.
2.  **Tool invocations**: Put quotas around tools that are costly, rate-limited, or have side effects. The [Limit Tool Counts hook](/docs/user-guide/concepts/agents/hooks/index.md#limit-tool-counts) shows the same pattern for Python and TypeScript and resets counts for each invocation.
3.  **Token consumption**: Use the invocation’s total-token and output-token limits for an end-to-end budget. Also configure the model’s `max_tokens``maxTokens` setting to cap a single response. Invocation token limits are checked between turns, so one model call can exceed the configured total before the loop stops.
4.  **Wall-clock time**: Enforce a deadline outside the invocation and cancel the agent when it expires. Python can call `agent.cancel()` from a watchdog; TypeScript can pass a `cancelSignal` to `invoke()`/`stream()` (for example, `AbortSignal.timeout(30_000)`) or call `agent.cancel()`. Cancellation is cooperative for work already running inside a tool, so propagate the same deadline to downstream network calls and blocking operations.

See [Invocation Limits](/docs/user-guide/concepts/agents/agent-loop/index.md#invocation-limits) for turn and token budgets, [Cancellation](/docs/user-guide/concepts/agents/agent-loop/index.md#cancellation) for timeout patterns, and [Stop Reasons](/docs/user-guide/concepts/agents/agent-loop/index.md#stop-reasons) for handling exhausted limits as expected outcomes rather than generic errors.

#### Multi-agent safety boundaries

Apply limits at both the orchestrator and node levels:

-   **Swarm**: Bound handoffs/iterations and total/per-node execution time in Python; use `maxSteps`, `timeout`, and `nodeTimeout` in TypeScript. See [Swarm Safety Mechanisms](/docs/user-guide/concepts/multi-agent/swarm/index.md#safety-mechanisms).
-   **Graph**: Bound total node executions and total/per-node execution time. The exact configuration names differ by SDK; see [Graph Components](/docs/user-guide/concepts/multi-agent/graph/index.md#graph-components).

Do not rely on only one boundary. For example, a turn limit does not constrain a single slow tool, while a timeout alone does not provide a predictable token budget.

### Conversation Management

Optimize memory usage and context window management in production:

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.agent.conversation_manager import SlidingWindowConversationManager

# Configure conversation management for production
conversation_manager = SlidingWindowConversationManager(
    window_size=10,  # Limit history size
)

agent = Agent(
    ...,
    conversation_manager=conversation_manager
)
```

The [`SlidingWindowConversationManager`](/docs/user-guide/concepts/agents/conversation-management/index.md#slidingwindowconversationmanager) helps prevent context window overflow exceptions by maintaining a reasonable conversation history size.

### Streaming for Responsiveness

For improved user experience in production applications, leverage streaming via `stream_async()` to deliver content to the caller as it’s received, resulting in a lower-latency experience:

```python
# For web applications
async def stream_agent_response(prompt):
    agent = Agent(...)

    ...

    async for event in agent.stream_async(prompt):
        if "data" in event:
            yield event["data"]
```

See [Async Iterators](/docs/user-guide/concepts/streaming/async-iterators/index.md) for more information.

### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling in production:

```python
try:
    result = agent("Execute this task")
except Exception as e:
    # Log the error
    logger.error(f"Agent error: {str(e)}")
    # Implement appropriate fallback
    handle_agent_error(e)
```

## Deployment Patterns

## Monitoring and Observability

For production deployments, implement comprehensive monitoring:

1.  **Tool Execution Metrics**: Monitor execution time and error rates for each tool.
2.  **Token Usage**: Track token consumption for cost optimization.
3.  **Response Times**: Monitor end-to-end response times.
4.  **Error Rates**: Track and alert on agent errors.

Consider integrating with AWS CloudWatch for metrics collection and alerting.

See [Observability](/docs/user-guide/observability-evaluation/observability/index.md) for more information.
