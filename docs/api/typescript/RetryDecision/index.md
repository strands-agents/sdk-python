Decision returned by a retry strategy’s per-event `compute*RetryDecision` method.

Discriminated union: `retry: true` carries the wait duration the framework will sleep for before re-invoking the failed operation. `retry: false` carries nothing — the error propagates to the caller.

Shared across retry kinds (model retries today; tool retries and others later) so all strategies speak the same decision shape.
