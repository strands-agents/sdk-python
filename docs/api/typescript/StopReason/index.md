Defined in: [src/types/messages.ts:710](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/blob/1941a726750c1659f10e010a1ea62106d31a24e3/strands-ts/src/types/messages.ts#L710)

Reason why the model stopped generating content.

-   `cancelled` - Agent invocation was cancelled via `agent.cancel()`
-   `contentFiltered` - Content was filtered by safety mechanisms
-   `endTurn` - Natural end of the model’s turn
-   `guardrailIntervened` - A guardrail policy stopped generation
-   `checkpoint` - Agent paused at a cycle boundary for durable execution (experimental; see experimental checkpoint module)
-   `interrupt` - Agent execution was interrupted for human input
-   `maxTokens` - The model provider’s per-call token cap was reached
-   `limitOutputTokens` - Agent loop stopped because `InvokeOptions.limits.outputTokens` was reached
-   `limitTotalTokens` - Agent loop stopped because `InvokeOptions.limits.totalTokens` was reached
-   `limitTurns` - Agent loop stopped because `InvokeOptions.limits.turns` was reached
-   `pauseTurn` - Model paused a long-running turn; the response should be sent back to continue
-   `refusal` - A streaming classifier intervened to handle a potential policy violation
-   `stopSequence` - A stop sequence was encountered
-   `toolUse` - Model wants to use a tool
-   `modelContextWindowExceeded` - Input exceeded the model’s context window
