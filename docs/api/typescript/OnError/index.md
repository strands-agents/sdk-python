type OnError = "throw" | "proceed" | "deny";

What to do when a handler throws during evaluation.

-   `'throw'` — rethrow the error (default, safest: a broken policy check blocks execution)
-   `'proceed'` — log the error and continue as if the handler returned Proceed
-   `'deny'` — log the error and treat it as a Deny (fail-closed)
