Configuration for prompt caching.

## Properties

### strategy?

```ts
optional strategy?: "auto" | "anthropic";
```

Defined in: [src/models/model.ts:79](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/blob/333885bbdabbb126ca305af4cc30d2214417e39c/strands-ts/src/models/model.ts#L79)

Whether to skip caching for models that do not support it.

-   “auto”: cache only when the model is known to support it
-   “anthropic”: cache without that check, for model identifiers it cannot inspect (an application inference profile, for example)

#### Default Value

```ts
'auto'
```

### ttl?

```ts
optional ttl?: CacheTTL;
```

Defined in: [src/models/model.ts:91](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/blob/333885bbdabbb126ca305af4cc30d2214417e39c/strands-ts/src/models/model.ts#L91)

TTL for every cache point, overridden by a per-section TTL. Provider default when omitted.

Bedrock requires checkpoint TTLs to be non-increasing across `toolConfig`, system and messages, and rejects a longer TTL that follows a shorter one. This TTL therefore also fills in for a cache point placed by hand in the system prompt that carries none of its own, so one value keeps every checkpoint in step. A TTL written on such a point is left as written, and a `toolsTTL` that differs from this one leaves the point at the provider default rather than landing a longer TTL behind a shorter checkpoint - either way, two TTLs in tension are yours to reconcile.

### toolsTTL?

```ts
optional toolsTTL?: boolean | CacheTTL;
```

Defined in: [src/models/model.ts:98](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/blob/333885bbdabbb126ca305af4cc30d2214417e39c/strands-ts/src/models/model.ts#L98)

Cache the tool definitions. A TTL sets this section’s duration; `false` disables it.

#### Default Value

```ts
true
```

---

### messagesTTL?

```ts
optional messagesTTL?: boolean | CacheTTL;
```

Defined in: [src/models/model.ts:106](https://github.com/strands-agents/harness-sdk/blob/333885bbdabbb126ca305af4cc30d2214417e39c/strands-ts/src/models/model.ts#L106)

Cache the conversation prefix, on the last user message. A TTL sets this section’s duration; `false` disables it.

#### Default Value

```ts
true
```
