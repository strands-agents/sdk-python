# Training Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the **Trainable Strands Agents with Continuous Learning** feature as requested in issue #923. This implementation provides comprehensive training capabilities for Strands Agents through trajectory capture and reward-based learning.

## ✅ Implementation Status

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Trajectory Capture System** (`src/strands/training/trajectory_capture.py`)
   - `TrajectoryCapture`: Records agent interactions, tool calls, and outcomes
   - `TrajectoryData`: Stores complete agent execution traces
   - `TrajectoryStep`: Individual steps within a trajectory
   - Integration with existing hook system for automatic capture

2. **Reward Function Framework** (`src/strands/training/reward_functions.py`)
   - `RewardFunction`: Abstract base class for reward functions
   - `TaskCompletionReward`: Rewards based on task success/failure
   - `EfficiencyReward`: Rewards based on step efficiency
   - `ToolUsageReward`: Rewards based on tool usage patterns
   - `CompositeRewardFunction`: Combines multiple reward functions
   - Predefined reward functions: `math_reward_fn()`, `coding_reward_fn()`, `general_reward_fn()`

3. **Training Environment** (`src/strands/training/env.py`)
   - `StrandsEnv`: Gym-like interface for training
   - Compatible with RL/SFT frameworks
   - Supports step-by-step agent interaction
   - Automatic reward computation

4. **Agent Trainer** (`src/strands/training/agent_trainer.py`)
   - `AgentTrainer`: Main training orchestrator
   - Dataset management and training loops
   - Integration with external RL/SFT frameworks
   - Comprehensive training metrics and history

5. **Integration API** (`src/strands/training/integration.py`)
   - Exact API match to the specification in issue #923
   - `StrandsAgent`, `StrandsEnv`, `AgentTrainer` classes
   - Seamless integration with existing Strands architecture

## ✅ API Compatibility

The implementation provides the exact API specified in the issue:

```python
from strands.training import StrandsAgent, StrandsEnv, AgentTrainer, math_reward_fn
from strands_tools import calculator

agent_args = {"tools": [calculator], 
              "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant."}

trainer = AgentTrainer(
    agent_class=StrandsAgent,
    env_class=StrandsEnv,
    agent_args=agent_args,
    env_args={"reward_fn": math_reward_fn()},
    config=training_config,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    val_dataset=validation_dataset,
)

trainer.train()
```
