    """Create a sandbox-routed file editor tool.

    If a ``sandbox`` is passed, it is bound at creation time. Otherwise the tool
    reads the sandbox from ``tool_context.agent.sandbox`` at call time. Used by
    sandbox implementations in :meth:`~strands.sandbox.base.Sandbox.get_tools`
    and by users who want a customized file editor.

    Undo history is kept per calling agent (keyed on ``tool_context.agent`` via
    a :class:`weakref.WeakKeyDictionary`), so two agents sharing one editor
    factory cannot see or overwrite each other's snapshots.

    Args:
        sandbox: Sandbox to bind at creation. When ``None``, the agent's
            configured sandbox is used at call time.
        name: Tool name. Defaults to ``"file_editor"``.
        description: Tool description shown to the model.
        root: Optional absolute directory that confines every operation. String-
            level checks reject non-absolute paths and any ``..`` traversal on
            the raw input; when the resolved target exists on the local host,
            ``os.path.realpath`` is also applied and the resulting path must
            still be inside ``root``. When ``root`` does not exist on the local
            host (e.g. a container-side path in a Docker/SSH sandbox), the
            editor fails closed on any operation: the local process cannot
            canonicalize container-side paths, so silently degrading to only a
            string-level check would leave the ``root`` guarantee unenforceable
            against a symlink inside the sandbox. When ``root`` is ``None``,
            only absolute-path and ``..``-traversal checks apply; the
            underlying sandbox's symlink policy governs escape.
        max_file_size: Maximum file size (bytes) accepted by view/edit
            commands. Defaults to 1 MB.
        max_undo_entries: Maximum number of distinct paths retained in the
            in-memory undo history *per agent*. Oldest entry is evicted on
            overflow. Defaults to 32.
        max_undo_bytes: Approximate cap on total bytes of file content held in
            the per-agent undo history (UTF-8). Oldest entries are evicted
            until the cap is met. Defaults to 32 MB.
