"""Shared instrumentation for SDK-internal (auxiliary) model calls.

Auxiliary model calls — summarization, routing classification, memory extraction, the web
fetch analyst, the HITL risk classifier, the goal judge, the steering handler — happen
outside the agent's main event loop, so they bypass its hooks, metrics, and traces.
:func:`instrument_auxiliary_model_call` wraps an auxiliary call's event stream to fire the
``Before/AfterAuxiliaryModelCallEvent`` hook pair, roll token usage into the owning agent's
:class:`~strands.telemetry.metrics.EventLoopMetrics` (tagged by source), and emit a
model-invoke span (tagged with ``strands.source``) parented under the active trace.
:func:`auxiliary_structured_output` is the convenience form for the common
"one structured answer from the model" shape.

Auxiliary features call the model directly — never a throwaway inner ``Agent`` — so every
source presents one contract to hook subscribers and metrics consumers.

    """Wrap an auxiliary model call's event stream with hooks, metrics, and a span.

    Fires ``BeforeAuxiliaryModelCallEvent`` before consuming the stream and
    ``AfterAuxiliaryModelCallEvent`` when it completes (successfully or not), adds the
    usage from the stream's terminal ``{"stop": (stop_reason, message, usage, metrics)}``
    event to ``agent.event_loop_metrics`` under ``source``, and emits a model-invoke span
    tagged with ``strands.source``. Events are yielded through unchanged. When ``agent`` is
    None (no owning agent is reachable from the call site), hooks and metrics are skipped
    but the span is still emitted so the call remains traceable.

    Args:
        events: The auxiliary call's event stream (e.g. from ``process_stream``,
            ``stream_messages``, or ``Model.structured_output``). Pass the stream
            *unstarted*: the hook-before-model-call guarantee holds because async
            generator bodies run only on first iteration, which happens here after
            the Before event — not because this helper defers anything itself.
            Streams without a
            ``"stop"`` event are passed through; hooks still fire, but no usage is
            recorded and ``stop_response`` is None. Note: only providers whose
            ``structured_output`` forwards stream events (e.g. Bedrock, Anthropic) emit
            the ``"stop"`` event on structured-output calls; for others the classifier's
            usage is not recorded today.
        source: The auxiliary feature making the call, e.g. ``"summarization"``.
        agent: The agent this call is made on behalf of, or None.
        messages: The messages sent to the model, exposed on the Before event and the span.
        invocation_state: Invocation state to expose on the hook events, when the call
            site has access to it.
        model_id: The model identifier, recorded on the span's ``gen_ai.request.model``.
        system_prompt: The system prompt sent to the model, exposed on the Before event
            and recorded on the span.

    Yields:
        The events from the wrapped stream, unchanged.
