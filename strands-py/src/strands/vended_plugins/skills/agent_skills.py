"""AgentSkills plugin for integrating Agent Skills into Strands agents.

This module provides the AgentSkills class that extends the Plugin base class
to add Agent Skills support. The plugin registers a tool for activating
skills, and injects skill metadata into the system prompt. With
``dynamic_loading=True`` the tool also exposes ``load`` / ``unload`` actions so
the agent can register additional skills from directories in its sandbox at
runtime (for example a ``skills/`` folder inside a repository it just cloned)
and remove them again.

Filesystem skill sources are loaded through the agent's sandbox (host or
container) at ``init_agent`` time, not at construction, so each agent sees the
skills present on its own filesystem. Skill instances and ``https://`` URLs are
sandbox-independent and resolve eagerly at construction.

:meth:`Skill.from_url` is synchronous, so URLs resolve at construction and no
readiness barrier is needed. The observable effect is benign: URL skills are

class AgentSkills(Plugin):
    """Plugin that integrates Agent Skills into a Strands agent.

    The AgentSkills plugin extends the Plugin base class and provides:

    1. A ``skills`` tool that allows the agent to activate skills on demand
    2. System prompt injection of available skill metadata before each invocation
    3. Session persistence of active skill state via ``agent.state``

    Skills can be provided as filesystem paths (to individual skill directories or
    parent directories containing multiple skills), ``https://`` URLs pointing to
    raw SKILL.md content, or as pre-built ``Skill`` instances.

    With ``dynamic_loading=True`` the ``skills`` tool becomes action-based, adding
    ``load`` / ``unload`` actions so the agent can register additional skills from
    directories in its sandbox at runtime (for example a ``skills/`` folder inside a
    repository it just cloned) and remove them again. Dynamically loaded paths are
    recorded in ``agent.state``, so they are restored on the next run over the same
    session (fail-soft: a path that no longer exists simply contributes nothing until
    it is re-loaded). Dynamic skills can never shadow the skills configured on the
    plugin. The matching programmatic methods (``load_skills_for`` /
    ``unload_skills_for``) are available regardless of the flag, which only controls
    the tool surface exposed to the model.

    Filesystem paths are read through the agent's sandbox at ``init_agent`` time,
    so each agent loads the skills present on its own filesystem (host or
    container). Skill instances and URLs are sandbox-independent and resolve at
    construction. As a result, ``get_available_skills`` returns filesystem skills
    only when passed the agent they were loaded for.

    Example:
        ```python
        from strands import Agent
        from strands.vended_plugins.skills import Skill, AgentSkills

        # Load from filesystem
        plugin = AgentSkills(skills=["./skills/pdf-processing", "./skills/"])

        # Or provide Skill instances directly
        skill = Skill(name="my-skill", description="A custom skill", instructions="Do the thing")
        plugin = AgentSkills(skills=[skill])

        # Let the agent load/unload additional skills from its sandbox at runtime
        plugin = AgentSkills(skills=["./skills/"], dynamic_loading=True)

        agent = Agent(plugins=[plugin])
