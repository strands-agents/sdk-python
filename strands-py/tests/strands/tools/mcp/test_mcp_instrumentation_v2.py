"""Trace-continuity tests for `MCPClient` on the `mcp` 2.x line.

The 2.x line carries OpenTelemetry natively: the client dispatcher injects
W3C trace context into every request's `_meta` inside a CLIENT span (SEP-414),
and servers extract it in their own middleware, so `mcp_instrumentation`
applies no patches there. These tests prove that the native path actually
connects a caller's trace across the client-server boundary, guarding the
decision to not patch on 2.x.

Every test is gated on the installed line via `MCP_V2` and skips under the
1.x dependency pin. The `unit-test-mcp-v2` CI job force-installs the 2.x
line over the pin and runs this file against the real package, with a real
in-process server: no external endpoint or credentials are required.
